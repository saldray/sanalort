Escape to Freedom: A video from the FSF What is GNU?
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects
From: zqian@umich.edu
users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages
(programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free
software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it

possible to use a computer without software that would trample your
freedom.
From: zqian@umich.edu
We recommend installable versions of GNU (more precisely, GNU/Linux
distributions) which are entirely free software. More about GNU below.

Movement?
From: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za

From: wagnermr@iupui.edu
The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing
the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its
From: zqian@umich.edu
users in control of their own computing. Nonfree software puts its
users under the power of the software's developer. See the video
explanation.  What is Free Software?
From: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za
Free software means the users have the freedom to run, copy,
distribute, study, change and improve the software.
From: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za
Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in
“free beer.”
From: david.horwitz@uct.ac.za
More precisely, free software means users of a program have the four
essential freedoms:
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
    The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
    (freedom 0).  The freedom to study how the program works, and
    change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
    1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  The
    freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
    others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community
    a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code
    is a precondition for this.
From: ray@media.berkeley.edu
Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms
even more important now than they were in 1983.
From: cwen@iupui.edu
Nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the GNU
system. See the Free Software Foundation's web site for more about
what we do, and a list of ways you can help.  More about GNU
From: zqian@umich.edu
GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of
many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even
games. The development of GNU, started in January 1984, is known as
the GNU Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released under the
auspices of the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.

The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is
pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing
the r with n.
From: cwen@iupui.edu
The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and
talks to the hardware is called the “kernel.” GNU is typically used
with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux
operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it
“Linux” by mistake.
From: wagnermr@iupui.edu
GNU's own kernel, the GNU Hurd, was started in 1990 (before Linux was
started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an
From: tnguyen@iupui.edu
interesting technical project.
